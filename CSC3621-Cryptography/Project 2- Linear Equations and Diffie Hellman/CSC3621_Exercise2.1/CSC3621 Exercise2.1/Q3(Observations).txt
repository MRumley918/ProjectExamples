To solve a linear equation ax + b=0 in ZN, the calculation of the modular multiplicative inverse, which can only be done if a and N are coprime- their greatest common denominator is 1. This is why the equation in 2b returns null, as the values of a and N are not coprime.
In question 2a, the value of N is odd, which means there will be more values for which the number is coprime than the even valued N value in question 2b, since all multiples of 2 can be automatically discounted from the set of values that are coprime. Therefore there is a much greater chance of an equation being solvable if it has an odd N value.
