Eve can break the Diffie-Hellman key exchange through a man in the middle attack. Eve intercepts Alice's public value and submits her own public value to Bob. When Bob sends his public value, Eve changes it with her own public value and sends that to Alice. Therefore Eve and Alice have one shared key and Eve and Bob share a different key. Then Eve can decrypt any message sent by Alice or Bob and modify it however they want, before re-encrypting it with the correct key and transmitting it to either Alice or Bob. This vulnerability is present because Diffie-Hellman does not authenticate its participants.
