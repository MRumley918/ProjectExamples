The duplication process takes the place of chan AtoB in Task 1, by sending the output data from process A first to a process
'dup' that sends 2 messages out for every one it receieves. This is then sent to a handler process that sorts the messages
receieved and only sends the correct ones back to process B. The rest of the program then proceeds in the same fashion as Task 1.
